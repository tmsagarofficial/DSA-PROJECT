The current manual processes used in our hospital are time-consuming, prone to errors, and do not provide real-time access to patient data. This results in inefficiencies, increased costs, and reduced patient satisfaction. Additionally, there is limited visibility into hospital operations, making it difficult to identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions. There is a need for a comprehensive and integrated system to manage the various aspects of hospital operations, including patient management, financial management, and resource utilization.
